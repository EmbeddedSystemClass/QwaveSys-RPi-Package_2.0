[**QwaveSys RPi package 2.0**](https://github.com/QWaveSystems/QwaveSys-RPi-Package_2.0) is a LabVIEW additional library based on [LINX 3.0.xx](http://sine.ni.com/nips/cds/view/p/lang/en/nid/212478) from [labviewmakerhub.com](https://www.labviewmakerhub.com) for Raspberry Pi. It's supported LabVIEW 2014 only for Non-commercial use.

Anyone can get started with the [LabVIEW 45-Day Evaluation](http://ftp.ni.com/support/softlib/labview/labview_development_system/2014%20SP1/2014sp1LV-WinEng.exe) and buy LabVIEW 2014 Home Edition for non-commercial use. 

QwaveSys RPi Package is a peripheral VIs provides enhance functions over LINX 3.0 standard library. it's an easy to use VIs and provided many examples. It's tested with Raspberry Pi 2B/3B and some functions also works with BBB and Orange Pi (H3) boards.
